  history: `The Foxtrot emerged in the summer of 1914, named after its creator, vaudeville actor Harry Fox. 
    Originally a fast-paced dance set to ragtime music, it evolved into the smooth, sophisticated style we know today. 
    The dance gained popularity in the ballroom scene during the 1920s and 1930s, eventually becoming a staple of 
    social dancing and competitive ballroom programs.`,
